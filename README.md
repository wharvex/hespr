# hespr

A modified version of Shankâ€”the modern, procedural, statically-typed, simple systems language.

## Run

### From IntelliJ

Clone the repo, open the root project folder in IntelliJ Idea, then run the main class (
com.wharvex.hespr.Hespr) with exactly one command line argument: the filepath of a hespr file.  
A file written in hespr that implements the GCD algorithm and demonstrates some features of hespr is
provided in the root project folder and named `gcd.hespr`

### From Command Line

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed, then run the following commands (tested in Linux):

```
git clone https://github.com/wharvex/hespr.git
cd hespr
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.wharvex.hespr.Hespr -Dexec.args="$(pwd)/gcd.hespr"
```

## Motivation

I wanted hespr to have a distinctive look but the same basic functionality as Shank.

## Syntax

### Overview

* Every keyword that can start a line is four letters long and indents are 5 spaces long, giving the
  code a kind of "aligned" look.
* Builtin functions start with a capital letter.
* Function calls are the function name followed by a bang (`!`) followed by space-separated
  arguments.
    * If an argument is a math operation, it must be surrounded by parentheses.
* Shank's "from" and "to" are replaced by an arrow syntax (`->`).
* Shank's assignment operator (`:=`) is replaced by what I call "the shovel" (`=_`), which you can
  think of as shoveling the value to the right of it back into the variable to the left of it.

### Keyword Replacements

## TODO

* Fix parsing logic to allow different parameter types in a function declaration.
* Rework Lexer.
* Rework Interpreter and/or write compiler.
* Make error handling more systematic/better organized.
