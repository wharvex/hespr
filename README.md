# hespr
A modified version of Shankâ€”the modern, procedural, statically-typed, simple systems language.  
## Run
### From IntelliJ
Clone the repo, open the root project folder in IntelliJ Idea, then run the main class (com.wharvex.hespr.Hespr) with exactly one command line argument: the filepath of a hespr file.  
A file written in hespr that implements the GCD algorithm and demonstrates some features of hespr is provided at hespr/gcd.hespr  
### From Command Line
If this does not work, or if you want to run the project from the command line, just make sure you have Java and Maven installed, then run the following commands (tested in Linux):
```
git clone https://github.com/wharvex/hespr.git
cd hespr
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.wharvex.hespr.Hespr -Dexec.args="$(pwd)/gcd.hespr"
```
## Motivation
I wanted hespr to have a distinctive look but the same basic functionality as Shank.
## Syntax
### Overview
* Every keyword is four letters long and indents are 5 spaces long, giving the code a kind of "aligned" look. 
* Builtin functions start with a capital letter.
* Function calls are the function name followed by a bang (!) followed by space-separated arguments.
* Several other changes were made to the main symbols used in Shank's syntax.
